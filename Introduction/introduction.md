# Introduction
The Unicorn Brain Interface is a consumer grade biosignal amplifier kit. It allows developers, artists and makers to integrate signals from the human body within their projects – ranging from simple display of the signals to designing and controlling attached devices and interacting with artistic installations, toys, computer programs or apps and more. The Unicorn Brain Interface acquires the EEG from eight Unicorn Hybrid EEG Electrodes. The Unicorn Brain Interface consists of the Unicorn Brain Interface Hybrid Black, Unicorn C Size M, Unicorn Hybrid EEG Electrodes, Unicorn USB Charging Cable and a Unicorn Bluetooth dongle to acquire data on a computer. The Unicorn Suite is the software environment, consisting of standalone applications and APIs to interface the Unicorn Brain Interface, acquire and process data and to perform BCI paradigms.

## Highlights
