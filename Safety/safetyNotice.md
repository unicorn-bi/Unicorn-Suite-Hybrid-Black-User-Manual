**Warning:**
- Conductible parts of all Unicorn Hybrid EEG Electrodes must not have contact with the earth or other conductible parts.
- Avoid electrostatic discharge impulses when handling the device or touching the Unicorn Hybrid EEG Electrodes.
- Pay attention to the precautions regarding electromagnetic compatibility.
- The operation of the device can be compromised within shielded rooms. In case of problems, relocate the receiving device or consult technical support.
- The operator must be familiar with the operation of the device and must operate the device according to the instructions for use.
- The device and its accessories must not be exposed to increased mechanical stress.
- Each time you use the device, you must first check the device and its accessories for possible damage to connectors, sockets and cables. Check the Unicorn Hybrid EEG electrode cable connections with special care and ensure that the electrode cables have no breaks or cracks. Any cables, connectors, accessories, or other parts of the equipment must be replaced immediately if damaged or not working correctly.
The Unicorn Brain Interface is not protected against electrical defibrillation - before defibrillation, the Unicorn Hybrid EEG Electrodes must be removed from the subject!
- Only use accessories identified for use with this device.
- The device is powered internally via a lithium-ion polymer accumulator. The accumulator must only be replaced by the manufacturer.
- The Unicorn Brain Interface uses special lightweight, thin and highly flexible cables for the Unicorn Hybrid EEG Electrodes to provide high comfort and easy cap mounting, especially for multi-channel recording. These cables are sensitive and need to be treated with special care. Following some basic guidelines will prolong the lifetime of Unicorn Hybrid EEG Electrodes:
    - Never pull on Unicorn Hybrid EEG Electrodes cables.
    - Avoid knots in cables.
    - Do not soak cables and Unicorn Hybrid EEG Electrodes for more than 30 minutes.
    - Avoid exposure to direct sunlight or chemical agents.
    - Make sure that no Unicorn Gel remains on Unicorn Hybrid EEG Electrodes or cables after cleaning.
    - Protect the amplifier unit from contamination with Unicorn Gel, water or disinfectant.
    - Always make sure that Unicorn Hybrid EEG Electrodes, cables and Unicorn caps are completely dry before storing.
    - Donâ€™t cut, kink or pinch electrode cables; light bending is safe.
- Unicorn Hybrid EEG Electrode and cable lifetime depends on proper usage, careful treatment and cleaning, and appropriate storage. The manufacturer will provide warranty replacement only if there is no visible physical damage to the parts, such as: damaged, broken or pinched cables; or damaged housings or connectors.
    - Do not use any detergent other than detergents mentioned in this manual!
    - Do not perform automated reprocessing in Washer Disinfectors (WD) or Endoscope Washer Disinfectors (EWD)!
    - Do not machine-wash!
    - Do not use a laundry dryer or other hot air devices!
    - Do not put into an ultrasonic bath!
    - Do not autoclave Unicorn caps or Unicorn Hybrid EEG Electrodes!
- The manufacturer is responsible for the safety, performance and reliability of the Unicorn Brain Interface as supplied to the customer at the time of delivery. This responsibility expires if the Unicorn Brain Interface is changed. Please note the following:
    - Changes to the Unicorn Brain Interface must be performed by the manufacturer only, and service and repair must be performed by corresponding qualified personnel only.
    - The Unicorn Brain Interface must be used according to the instructions for use.
- The Unicorn Brain Interface and its components have been tested and comply with the electromagnetic compliance limits for the Directive 2014/53/EU (radio equipment directive, RED). See the chapter on Electromagnetic compatibility. The equipment, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause interference with other devices in the vicinity. If this equipment does interfere with other devices, which can be determined by turning the equipment off and on, try to correct the interference through one or more of the following measures:
    - Reorient or relocate the receiving device.
    - Increase the separation between the equipment.
    - Consult Unicorn technical support.
- The Unicorn Brain Interface must not be used in dangerous conditions such as wet rooms or explosive environments. The relative humidity must be between 25 % and 80 %. The Unicorn Brain Interface must not be used in combination with any other high-frequency device. Using a high frequency device with the Unicorn Brain Interface can cause burning under the Unicorn Hybrid EEG Electrodes and could damage the Unicorn Brain Interface.
- The Unicorn Brain Interface must not be used in humans with pace-makers or electrical stimulators.
- The Unicorn Brain Interface uses the 2.4 GHz band for wireless transmission. Ensure that enough transmission bandwidth is available in your environment, since other devices might also use the same band (e.g. WiFi or other Bluetooth devices).
